/**
 * The document, served at `/app`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a string and not an `index.html`
 *
 * Not for the reason the sibling modules that hold material have one. They
 * generate a page because a per-process write ticket has to reach it without
 * being fetchable on a door of its own; this module has no ticket, because it
 * has no writes.
 *
 * It is generated here for the other reason, which is a collision a sibling lost
 * half a day to. `entry` is `/app`, and under Vite dev an extensionless path is
 * not free — a request for `/app` next to an `app.tsx` resolves to that module
 * and answers `200 text/javascript` with compiled source. A browser loads such a
 * document happily and runs nothing in it: the frame's `load` fires, the host
 * greets it, and nothing answers. Claiming `/app` in middleware before Vite's
 * resolver sees it is what prevents that, and this repository has a
 * `src/app.tsx`, so the order is load-bearing rather than defensive.
 *
 * ## The two style rules that live in the document rather than in the CSS
 *
 * `height: 100%` on `html`, `body` and the root, and `overflow: hidden` on the
 * body. Both are facts about the DOCUMENT rather than about anything drawn in
 * it, and this module needs them the way a file tree does and a note-taker does
 * not.
 *
 * A viewer is a container that scrolls INTERNALLY. Notes and paper measure their
 * content and ask the host for a frame that tall; a viewer cannot, because a
 * four-thousand-line file would be asking for an eighty-thousand-pixel frame. So
 * this page takes the height it is given and scrolls inside it — which requires
 * that the height it is given actually reach the scroll container, and a default
 * `html { height: auto }` silently breaks that chain: the container measures
 * zero and the file appears to be empty with no error anywhere.
 *
 * `overflow: hidden` on the body is the standing rule of this workspace made
 * literal at the one level it belongs: the BODY never scrolls, in either
 * direction. Everything that scrolls does so in a container inside it, which is
 * the only arrangement where a horizontal overflow is impossible rather than
 * merely unlikely — and this is the module where that matters most, because the
 * thing on screen is lines of code whose length nobody chose.
 *
 * Nothing else is drawn here. There is a root element and one script; every line
 * is built by React out of what this app's own `/api` answers and what the host
 * says on the wire, neither of which this file can see.
