 * Every door this app answers on, served by the one process that serves the

 *
 * ## Why they cannot be a second server
 *
 * A module is ONE ORIGIN or it is nothing: the protocol refuses a manifest whose
 * `entry` points anywhere but the origin that served the manifest, and it is
 * right to — a program that could name somebody else's page would be a program
 * that could have the host frame somebody else.
 *
 * Here that reaches further than the manifest. The page fetches `/api/source` as
 * a relative path, which is how the app works with nothing else running at all.
 * A reader on a second port would make every one of those fetches cross-origin —
 * and would mean this app could not read its own answers inside the frame it
 * exists to live in. So the doors are middleware in front of the same server
 * that serves the page, and `doors.ts` holds the deciding without holding a
 * socket.

/**
 * The dev server, and the one line missing from it that matters most.
 *
 * ## No `server.cors` — this module declares storage instead
 *
 * Modules that hold nothing usually set `cors: true` and have to. A host frames a
 * module WITHOUT `allow-same-origin` unless its manifest declares storage, which
 * puts the page on an opaque origin — and `<script type="module">` is ALWAYS
 * fetched in CORS mode, so with no permissive header not one script in the page
 * runs. The document loads, `load` fires, the host greets it, and nothing
 * answers. `curl` cannot see it, being unsubject to CORS; only the browser
 * console can. That has cost this workspace days.
 *
 * This module must not go that way, for the worst reason any module here has. A
 * permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on this port means any page in any
 * tab can ask it for the CONTENTS of any file under any project on this machine,
 * and read the answer. The explorer's version of that hole leaks what your files
 * are called; this one leaks what they say.
 *
 * So the manifest declares `storage: true` and this line is absent. With a real
 * origin, this page's scripts and its `/api` calls are ordinary same-origin
 * requests: no CORS is involved at all and nothing is offered to strangers.
 *
 * ## No alias for `roadmap-module-protocol`
 *
 * There used to be one, in every app here, pointing at the protocol's source in
 * the repository they all used to live in. It must not come back: the package's
 * `exports` are correct, reaching past them is what made a whole class of bug
 * possible, and a module that resolved its contract differently from the host it
 * talks to is a module testing something nobody ships.
 *
 * The `@` alias below is a different thing entirely — it points inside this
 * repository, at `src`, and is what shadcn's generated components import through.
 *
 * ## There is no `build` script, and no `build` here worth having
 *
 * `run.sh` runs Vite. Nothing serves a `dist/`, so a build would produce a second
 * answer to "what does this page say" which disagrees with the first the moment
 * somebody edits `src/`. It also could not succeed: the page is generated by the
 * middleware above and there is no `index.html` for Rollup to start from.
