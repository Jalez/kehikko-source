/**
 * The fence, and the only place in this program that decides whether a path may
 * be opened.
 *
 * This is the most dangerous file in the module, and it is more dangerous here
 * than in the explorer it was copied from. That module answers with NAMES; this
 * one answers with CONTENTS. A hole in the explorer's fence leaks a directory
 * listing. A hole in this one hands over `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to whatever asked,
 * and what asks is a passage — a path a stranger's program put on the canvas.
 * The protocol says so itself, at `passageSchema`: a consumer that resolves a
 * passage path and opens it "is opening a path a stranger's program chose, and
 * owes itself the confinement check it would owe any other".
 *
 * It is small on purpose, it is pure apart from one `realpath` call, and
 * `test/confine.test.ts` exists entirely to try to get past it.
 *
 * ## Two checks, and neither is sufficient alone
 *
 * **`resolve` first.** `join(root, '../../etc')` is a string containing `..`
 * and `resolve` is what turns it into the path it actually means. A prefix
 * check run before resolution is checking a string nobody will open.
 *
 * **`realpath` second.** Resolution is lexical: it knows nothing about
 * symlinks. `<root>/link` where `link -> /etc` resolves to a path that starts
 * with the root and opens somewhere else entirely. So the resolved path is
 * realpath'd and the check is made against the ANSWER — which is also why the
 * root is realpath'd, since comparing a real path against a symlinked root
 * (`/tmp` is `/private/tmp` on macOS, and this workspace's tests run in
 * `mkdtemp` under it) rejects everything.
 *
 * ## The failure this shape is written against, which happened in this workspace
 *
 * A sibling module had a version of this that fell back to a LEXICAL prefix
 * comparison when it could not `realpath` the target — the reasoning being that
 * a file which does not exist yet is not an escape. It is: a path that cannot
 * be resolved is a path this program knows nothing about, and "it is probably
 * fine" is not a sentence a fence gets to say. That fallback was removed on the
 * day this module was written, and this file has never had one. **A path that
 * cannot be realpath'd is refused.** There is no branch below where a lexical
 * comparison is the last word.
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating so nobody re-adds it as a bug fix: this app
 * cannot show a file that does not exist. That is correct — there is nothing in
 * it to show.
 *
 * ## The separator is not decoration
 *
 * `'/project-evil'.startsWith('/project')` is true. It is the oldest bug in
 * this family and it is a prefix check written by somebody who was thinking
 * about directories while the language was thinking about strings. So the
 * comparison is against `root + sep`, with the root itself allowed as its own
 * special case, and there is a test named after `/project-evil`.
 *
 * ## What a refusal is
 *
 * `null`, always, with no distinction between "outside the root", "does not
 * exist" and "cannot be read". That is deliberate. Three different refusals is
 * an oracle: a caller that can tell "outside the root" from "does not exist"
 * can probe for the existence of files it is not allowed to see, one question
 * at a time. Callers here get one word back and the word is no.
 *
 * ## The root itself is not confined by this file
 *
 * `inside()` answers "is this path inside that root", which is a relative
 * question. Which roots are permissible at all is a separate decision and it
 * lives in `rootOf` below, because the two have different answers: the root
 * comes from the host's context and a path comes from a request.

     * The one deliberate departure from the fence this was copied from, and it
     * is a bug found by pointing the real module at a real project rather than
     * by reading the code.
     *
     * ## What goes wrong without this branch
     *
     * The caller here is a passage, and a passage carries an ABSOLUTE path built
     * by whichever module pointed the canvas — almost always the host's
     * `projectPath` with something joined onto it. `rootOf` has already
     * realpath'd the root. So if `projectPath` runs through a symlink, and on
     * macOS every temporary directory does (`/tmp` is `/private/tmp`,
     * `/var/folders/…` is `/private/var/folders/…`), the passage says
     * `/var/…/project/file.ts` while this fence holds
     * `/private/var/…/project`. `resolve` cannot reconcile them — a realpath
     * cannot be inverted — the lexical check fails, and the module refuses every
     * file in the project it was pointed at, with the same sentence it uses for
     * `/etc/shadow`. A viewer that shows nothing, ever, and blames the file.
     *
     * ## Why the extra `realpath` is affordable here and not in general
     *
     * The sibling module refuses lexically at this point and never touches disk,
     * because doing a `realpath` on a path outside the root in order to then
     * decide we were not allowed to is an existence oracle with extra steps.
     * That argument is sound and it is kept for the case it was written about:
     * a RELATIVE path that resolved outside the root got there through `..`,
     * which is the traversal attack, and it is refused below without a syscall.
     *
     * An ABSOLUTE path that resolved outside the root is a different animal. It
     * is not a traversal; it is a passage naming somewhere else, which is what a
     * second spelling of the same directory looks like. So it gets exactly one
     * `realpath`, and it is judged on the answer.
     *
     * What that costs is one `stat` of a path the caller already named in full,
     * whose result is the same `null` either way. What it buys is a module that
     * works on a project whose path contains a symlink, which is every project
     * under `/tmp` and, for anybody whose home directory is linked, all of them.

/**
 * Which directories may be a root at all.
 *
 * ## The root does not come from a request, and yet it arrives in one
 *
 * The rule this module is built to keep is that the project root comes from the
 * host's context rather than from a parameter a page chose. That is true of
 * where the value ORIGINATES — `context.projectPath`, sent by the host to every
 * framed module — and it cannot be true of how it travels, because this server
 * is not on the canvas and is never handed a context. The page reads
 * `projectPath` off the wire and sends it with each read; an agent at `/mcp`
 * types it. From the server's side both are strings in a request, and pretending
 * otherwise would be a comment that lies.
 *
 * So the guarantee this program can actually keep is stated in two halves, and
 * both are enforced:
 *
 *   1. **Relative confinement, always.** Whatever the root is, no `path` in a
 *      request can leave it. That is `inside()` above and it is unconditional.
 *   2. **Absolute confinement, when somebody configures it.** `SOURCE_ROOTS`
 *      is a colon-separated list of absolute directories. Set it, and a root
 *      outside every one of them is refused — which turns "the caller picks the
 *      root" into "the caller picks among the roots the operator allowed".
 *
 * Unset is the default and it is honest about what it is: this app will show
 * files under whatever directory it is pointed at by whoever can reach the
 * port, and the fence around that is loopback and the browser's same-origin
 * policy — see the storage essay in `manifest.ts`. That is the same posture
 * every module here has, and naming it beats a check that looks like a fence
 * and is a suggestion.
 *
 * What is refused in every configuration: a relative root, an empty root, and a
 * root this process cannot realpath. A relative root would resolve against this
 * module's own directory and quietly serve this app's own source to somebody who
 * thought they were asking about their project.
