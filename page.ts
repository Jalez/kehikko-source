/* The one place this page's head is written: the dev server (`vite.config.ts`) and the build (`build.ts`) both use it. */

/**
 * The two style rules that live in the document rather than in the CSS, handed to the protocol's
 * `pageDocument` as its `head`.
 *
 * `height: 100%` on `html`, `body` and the root, and `overflow: hidden` on the body. A file is
 * something this page scrolls INTERNALLY: it takes the height it is given and scrolls inside it —
 * which requires that the height actually reach the scroll container. A default
 * `html { height: auto }` silently breaks that chain: the container measures zero and the file
 * appears to be empty with no error anywhere.
 *
 * `overflow: hidden` on the body is the standing rule of this workspace made literal: the BODY
 * never scrolls, in either direction. Everything that scrolls does so in a container inside it —
 * and this is the module where that matters most, because the thing on screen is lines of code
 * whose length nobody chose.
