/**
 * Tell a host on this machine where this app answers.
 *
 *   bun run register            # or: PORT=7980 bun run register
 *
 * A separate program from `run.sh` on purpose. Registration writes into
 * somebody's home directory and says "frame this", which is a decision a person
 * makes once; a start script that did it quietly would be making that decision on
 * their behalf every time they pressed start.
 *
 * ## The filename is the module id
 *
 * Not a field inside the file — the NAME. A host sweeps the directory and takes
 * the id from the filename, so `roadmap.source.json` is what makes this
 * `roadmap.source`. Two files naming the same port under different names are two
 * modules as far as a host is concerned.
 *
 * ## `dir` as well as `url`
 *
 * The url is where to talk to this app; the directory is where to start it. A
 * host that has only the first can frame a running module and can do nothing at
 * all about a stopped one, which in practice means a container saying "nothing is
 * answering" beside a Start button that is not there. With both, the host runs
 * `run.sh` inside this directory — one script, no arguments, for the reason that
 * file gives.
 *
 * It is this file's own location rather than a string, so a checkout moved or
 * cloned somewhere else registers itself correctly by being run.
 *
 * ## Where a host looks
 *
 * This line must say exactly what a host's own registry sweep says, and it is
 * copied rather than imported because this directory is meant to stand alone.
 * Writing to the wrong directory is the worst failure a module can have: the host
 * finds nothing, and finds it silently.

 * somebody else had would answer nothing, or worse, would fail to start while its
 * neighbour went on serving a page the host attributed to this one. `run.sh`
